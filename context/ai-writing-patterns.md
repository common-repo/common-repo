## Header Patterns

Avoid these formulaic section headers:

- "The Problem" / "The Solution"
- "Why This Matters"
- "Key Takeaways"
- "The Bottom Line"
- "What You'll Learn"
- "In This Guide"
- "Overview" (when followed by "The Problem/Solution")

Better alternatives:
- Use descriptive headers that say what the section contains
- "Why [tool name]?" instead of "The Problem/Solution"
- Just remove unnecessary meta-headers

## Opening Patterns

Avoid these sentence starters:

- "Think of it as..."
- "Whether you're..."
- "Imagine..."
- "Picture this..."
- "Have you ever wondered..."
- "In today's [digital age/fast-paced world/modern landscape]..."
- "In the realm of..."
- "When it comes to..."
- "It's no secret that..."
- "Let's face it..."
- "Here's the thing..."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "The fact of the matter is..."
- "It goes without saying..."

## Transition Patterns

Avoid overusing:

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| At its core... | Fundamentally, Essentially |
| Worth noting... | Note that, Also |
| Simply put... | (just say it simply) |
| That being said... | However, But |
| From a broader perspective... | More broadly |
| Moving forward... | Next, Going forward |
| With that in mind... | So, Therefore |
| It's important to note... | Note: |
| As mentioned earlier... | (reference specifically or omit) |
| In other words... | (rephrase clearly the first time) |
| To put it another way... | (say it clearly once) |
| All things considered... | Overall |
| By the same token... | Similarly |
| On the flip side... | However, Conversely |

Also avoid starting every paragraph with:
- "Firstly," "Secondly," "Thirdly"
- "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally"
- "In conclusion," "To summarize"
- "On the other hand," "In contrast"

## Hedging Language

AI overuses qualifiers. Use sparingly:

- "generally speaking"
- "typically"
- "tends to"
- "arguably"
- "to some extent"
- "in many cases"
- "more often than not"
- "for the most part"
- "by and large"
- "as a general rule"

When you know something, state it directly.

## Filler Phrases

Remove entirely:

- "It's worth mentioning that..."
- "It should be noted that..."
- "It's important to understand that..."
- "One thing to keep in mind is..."
- "The key thing to remember is..."
- "What's particularly interesting is..."
- "What makes this unique is..."
- "This is particularly relevant because..."
- "This is especially true when..."

## Buzzword Phrases

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "leverage synergies" | work together |
| "drive innovation" | create new things |
| "move the needle" | make progress |
| "circle back" | follow up |
| "take it offline" | discuss later |
| "boil the ocean" | do too much |
| "peel back the onion" | examine closely |
| "drink from the firehose" | learn a lot quickly |

| "core competencies" | skills, strengths |
| "key differentiator" | advantage |
| "value-add" | benefit |
| "win-win" | mutual benefit |
| "at scale" | widely |
| "end-to-end" | complete |

## Structural Patterns

Avoid these AI writing habits:

1. **Rigid paragraph structure** - Every paragraph has topic sentence → evidence → summary
2. **Uniform sentence length** - Natural writing varies between short and long sentences
3. **Overconfident assertions** - Humans hedge appropriately; AI states everything definitively
4. **Generic metaphors** - "weaving a rich tapestry," "painting a vivid picture"
5. **Lack of specifics** - AI uses abstract language; humans give concrete examples
6. **Excessive polish** - Real writing has casual phrasing and minor imperfections
7. **Missing personality** - No opinions, preferences, or personal voice

## What Good Technical Writing Looks Like

- **Direct** - Says what it means without preamble
- **Specific** - Uses concrete examples, not abstract descriptions
- **Varied** - Mixes sentence lengths and structures naturally
- **Opinionated** - Takes positions when appropriate
- **Imperfect** - Occasionally informal, sometimes terse
- **Practical** - Focuses on what users need to do

## Examples

**Bad (AI-sounding):**
> Delve into the comprehensive documentation to harness the robust capabilities of this transformative tool. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just embarking on your coding journey, this guide will illuminate the path forward.

**Good (human-sounding):**
> Read the docs to learn how the tool works. The examples section has the most common patterns.

**Bad:**
> At its core, this paradigm-shifting framework leverages cutting-edge technology to seamlessly orchestrate your workflow, unlocking unprecedented levels of productivity.

**Good:**
> This framework automates repetitive tasks so you can focus on the interesting parts.
