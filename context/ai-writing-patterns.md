- "Key Takeaways"
- "The Bottom Line"
- "What You'll Learn"
- "In This Guide"

| Worth noting... | Note that, Also |
| Simply put... | (just say it simply) |
| That being said... | However, But |
| From a broader perspective... | More broadly |
| Moving forward... | Next, Going forward |
| With that in mind... | So, Therefore |
| It's important to note... | Note: |
| As mentioned earlier... | (reference specifically or omit) |
| In other words... | (rephrase clearly the first time) |
| To put it another way... | (say it clearly once) |
| All things considered... | Overall |
| By the same token... | Similarly |
| On the flip side... | However, Conversely |

Also avoid starting every paragraph with:
- "Firstly," "Secondly," "Thirdly"
- "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Additionally"
- "In conclusion," "To summarize"

## Hedging Language

AI overuses qualifiers. Use sparingly:

- "generally speaking"
- "typically"
- "tends to"
- "arguably"
- "to some extent"
- "in many cases"
- "more often than not"
- "for the most part"
- "by and large"

| "key differentiator" | advantage |
| "value-add" | benefit |
| "win-win" | mutual benefit |
| "at scale" | widely |
| "out of the box" | built-in, default |

## Enthusiasm Patterns

## Structural Patterns

Avoid these AI writing habits:

1. **Rigid paragraph structure** - Every paragraph has topic sentence → evidence → summary
2. **Uniform sentence length** - Natural writing varies between short and long sentences
3. **Overconfident assertions** - Humans hedge appropriately; AI states everything definitively
4. **Generic metaphors** - "weaving a rich tapestry," "painting a vivid picture"
5. **Lack of specifics** - AI uses abstract language; humans give concrete examples
6. **Excessive polish** - Real writing has casual phrasing and minor imperfections
7. **Missing personality** - No opinions, preferences, or personal voice
8. **Everything is a list** - Prose would often be clearer
9. **Numbered steps for trivial tasks** - "Step 1: Open the file. Step 2: Read it."
10. **Repeating the question** - Restating what was asked before answering
11. **Summary that repeats** - Ending with summary that just echoes the content
12. **Parallel structure obsession** - Every bullet formatted identically
13. **Excessive formatting** - Bold, italic, code spans on everything
14. **Generic examples** - "foo", "bar", "example.com", "user123"
15. **Over-explaining simple things** - Treating readers as beginners
16. **Under-explaining complex things** - Superficial coverage of hard topics
17. **"The following" references** - "The following steps", "The following example"
18. **"Above/below" references** - "As shown above", "See below"

## Permission/Invitation Patterns

- "Feel free to..."

- "There's no wrong way to..."
- "You've got this!"

## Promise Patterns

- "By the end of this guide, you'll..."
- "After reading this, you'll be able to..."
- "Once you understand X, you'll never..."
- "This will help you..."
- "You'll learn how to..."

## Inclusivity Hedging

- "Whether you're a beginner or an expert..."
- "No matter your skill level..."
- "Regardless of your experience..."
- "For developers of all levels..."
- "Even if you've never..."

## Wordy Phrases

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| in order to | to |
| due to the fact that | because |
| prior to | before |

| it is important to note that | (just state it) |
| the fact that | that, (omit) |
| in light of the fact that | because, since |
| despite the fact that | although |
| owing to the fact that | because |

## Weak Sentence Starters

- "There is/are..." → restructure to lead with subject
- "It is X that..." → simplify
- "It should be noted that..." → just state it
- "It can be seen that..." → (omit)
- "It goes without saying..." → (then don't say it)
- "It is worth mentioning..." → just mention it
- "It is interesting to note..." → (omit)

## Weasel Words

Vague attributions that sound authoritative but say nothing:

- "Some people say..."
- "It is believed that..."
- "Many experts think..."
- "Studies show..." (without citation)
- "Research suggests..." (without citation)
- "It is widely accepted..."
- "It is generally known..."
- "Conventional wisdom holds..."

## Meta-Commentary

Commenting on the writing itself:

- "As mentioned earlier..."
- "As we discussed..."
- "As we'll see later..."
- "As I said before..."
- "Let me explain..."
- "Allow me to elaborate..."
- "I should mention..."
- "I want to point out..."
- "It bears repeating..."

## Certainty Markers

Often false confidence:

- "Clearly,..."
- "Obviously,..."
- "It's clear that..."
- "It's obvious that..."
- "Undoubtedly,..."
- "Without a doubt,..."
- "Of course,..."
- "Naturally,..."
- "Needless to say,..."

## Not Only/But Also

Overused parallel structure. Often one clause suffices.

## Emoji and Exclamation Overuse

In professional/technical docs, avoid:

- 🎉 🚀 ✨ 💡 🔥 👍 etc.
- Multiple exclamation marks!!!
- Exclamation marks for routine statements!

## Passive Voice Overuse

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| "The file is created by the function" | "The function creates the file" |
| "Errors are handled by the system" | "The system handles errors" |
| "The configuration is loaded at startup" | "The app loads configuration at startup" |
| "It was decided that..." | "We decided..." / "The team decided..." |

## Nominalization

Using noun forms instead of verbs:

| Nominalized | Direct |
|-------------|--------|
| "make a decision" | "decide" |
| "perform an analysis" | "analyze" |
| "conduct an investigation" | "investigate" |
| "give consideration to" | "consider" |
| "make an improvement" | "improve" |
| "provide assistance" | "help" |
| "reach a conclusion" | "conclude" |

## Example Introductions

Often unnecessary:

- "For example,..." → (just give the example)
- "For instance,..." → (just give the example)
- "Consider the following example:..." → (just show it)
- "To illustrate,..." → (just illustrate)
- "As an example,..." → (just give it)

## Acknowledgment/Validation (Conversational)

When responding to users, AI over-validates:

- "That's a great question!"
- "Great point!"
- "You raise an interesting question."
- "That's an excellent observation."
- "You're absolutely right."
- "Good thinking!"
- "Smart question!"
- "I'm glad you asked."
- "Thanks for bringing that up."

## Apology Patterns

- "I apologize for any confusion."
- "Sorry for the inconvenience."
- "I apologize if that wasn't clear."
- "My apologies for the oversight."
- "Sorry, I should have mentioned..."

## Temporal Markers

Vague time references:

- "In recent years..."
- "Nowadays..."
- "In today's world..."
- "In the modern era..."
- "As of late..."
- "Moving forward..." (when not actually about future)
- "Going forward..."
- "Historically speaking..."

## The Triple Pattern

AI loves groups of three:

- "X, Y, and Z"
- "First... Second... Third..."
- "Simple, fast, and reliable"
- Three bullet points when two or four would be natural

Not always wrong, but suspiciously consistent.

## Comparative Structures

Overused comparison openers:

- "Unlike X, Y..."
- "Compared to X, Y..."
- "In contrast to X..."
- "While X does A, Y does B..."
- "Whereas X..."
- "As opposed to X..."

## Code Documentation Patterns

In comments and docstrings:

- "This function does X" (obvious from name)
- "Returns: the result" (uninformative)
- "Parameters: see above" (lazy)
- "TODO: implement" (left behind)
- "Self-explanatory" (it's not)
- "// Initialize variables" (obvious)
- "// Loop through array" (obvious)
- "// Return result" (obvious)

## Changelog/Release Note Patterns

- "Various bug fixes and improvements"
- "Performance improvements"
- "Minor fixes"
- "Stability improvements"
- "General improvements"
- "Updated dependencies"
- "Code cleanup"

These say nothing. Be specific about what changed.

## What Good Technical Writing Looks Like

- **Direct** - Says what it means without preamble
- **Specific** - Uses concrete examples, not abstract descriptions
- **Varied** - Mixes sentence lengths and structures naturally
- **Opinionated** - Takes positions when appropriate
- **Imperfect** - Occasionally informal, sometimes terse
- **Practical** - Focuses on what users need to do

## Examples

**Bad (AI-sounding):**
> Delve into the comprehensive documentation to harness the robust capabilities of this transformative tool. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just embarking on your coding journey, this guide will illuminate the path forward.

**Good (human-sounding):**
> Read the docs to learn how the tool works. The examples section has the most common patterns.

**Bad:**
> At its core, this paradigm-shifting framework leverages cutting-edge technology to seamlessly orchestrate your workflow, unlocking unprecedented levels of productivity.

**Good:**
> This framework automates repetitive tasks so you can focus on the interesting parts.
