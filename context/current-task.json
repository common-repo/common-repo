  "instructions": "Convert context/improving-test-coverage-plan.md from markdown format to JSON task format following the project's JSON task structure conventions. The goal is to create a structured, parseable task plan that agents can follow for improving test coverage. Key conversion requirements:\n\n1. **Read source file**: context/improving-test-coverage-plan.md contains the current test coverage status and priorities\n\n2. **Create JSON task file**: context/improving-test-coverage-plan.json following the structure in CLAUDE.md's Agent Effectiveness Guidelines section\n\n3. **Structure requirements**:\n   - plan_name: 'Improving Test Coverage'\n   - last_updated: current date (YYYY-MM-DD)\n   - session_startup: standard startup steps from CLAUDE.md\n   - tasks: array of task objects with id, name, status, priority, blocked_by, output_file, steps, acceptance_criteria\n\n4. **Task conversion**:\n   - Priority 1 modules (check.rs, update.rs) are COMPLETE - mark status='complete'\n   - Priority 2.1 (phases.rs) is IN PROGRESS - this becomes the main focus with multiple sub-tasks\n   - Priority 2.2-2.3 (version.rs, git.rs) are COMPLETE\n   - Priority 3 modules are all COMPLETE\n\n5. **Focus area for phases.rs tasks**:\n   - Phase 1: Discovery & Cloning error handling\n   - Phase 2: Processing edge cases\n   - Phase 5: Merge operations (YAML, JSON, TOML, INI, Markdown) - this is the largest gap\n   - Phase 6: Write to disk error paths\n\n6. **After creating JSON file**:\n   - Update current-task.json to point to the new JSON plan file\n   - Delete or archive the markdown version if appropriate\n   - Verify the JSON is valid and parseable\n\n7. **Acceptance criteria**:\n   - JSON file is valid (parseable)\n   - All modules from markdown are represented\n   - Status fields accurately reflect current state\n   - Tasks have concrete, actionable steps\n   - blocked_by relationships are properly defined"
