# Project Overview

This is a Rust project with automated tooling for code quality, conventional commits, and semantic versioning. The project is configured for modern development practices with comprehensive CI/CD automation.

## LLM Context Files

The `context/` directory contains task tracking for LLM assistants:

- `context/current-task.json` - Points to active task and its plan file
- `context/completed/` - Archived plans and status files

**Important Notes:**
- For human-readable documentation, see `context/purpose.md` and `context/design.md`
- Use archived files in `context/completed/` to understand project architecture and completed work

## Requirements

- **Rust**: Stable channel (automatically managed via `rust-toolchain.toml`)
  - The project requires Rust stable with support for edition 2024 features
  - Install Rust from https://rustup.rs/
  - The toolchain file will automatically ensure you have the correct version
- **cargo-nextest**: Required for running tests (see setup instructions below)
- **prek**: Recommended for pre-commit hooks (Rust-based, faster than Python pre-commit)
  - **IMPORTANT**: Install from GitHub (`cargo install --git https://github.com/j178/prek`) as crates.io version is outdated
  - Alternative: **pre-commit** (Python-based, works as fallback)

## Quick Setup

This project follows the [Scripts to Rule Them All](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern for a normalized development workflow.

For first-time setup after cloning:

**Option 1: Manual installation (RECOMMENDED to avoid timeouts):**
```bash
# Install development tools individually to avoid compilation timeouts
cargo install cargo-nextest --locked
cargo install --git https://github.com/j178/prek --locked

# Then run setup to configure hooks and build the project
./script/setup
```

**Option 2: Automated setup (may timeout during compilation):**
```bash
# Set up the project (installs dependencies and configures environment)
# WARNING: This compiles cargo-nextest and prek, which may timeout in resource-constrained environments
./script/setup
```

The setup process will:
- Install Rust toolchain (via rust-toolchain.toml)
- Install cargo-nextest (using cargo-binstall if available, otherwise cargo install)
- Install prek (Rust-based pre-commit tool) and configure hooks
- Build the project to warm the cache

**Note**: If `./script/setup` times out during cargo-nextest or prek installation, use Option 1 to install these tools individually first.

### Available Scripts

- `./script/bootstrap` - Install all dependencies
- `./script/setup` - Set up project for first-time use (calls bootstrap)
- `./script/update` - Update project after pulling changes
- `./script/test` - Run the test suite (uses cargo-nextest if available)
- `./script/cibuild` - Run CI build locally (formatting, linting, tests)

## Project Structure

This is primarily a library crate for managing repository inheritance and file composition across multiple Git repositories. The binary name is `common-repo` (matches the package name in Cargo.toml).

Key directories:
- `src/` - Source code (library crate)
- `tests/` - Test files (unit and integration tests)
- `context/` - LLM context files (temporary, for development)
- `docs/` - Human-readable documentation
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD workflows
