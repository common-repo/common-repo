# Documentation Style Guide

## Rust Documentation

Create documentation following the [Rustdoc guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/how-to-write-documentation.html) and the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/) as well as the [Rustdoc std-dev style guide](https://std-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/development/how-to-write-documentation.html).

## General Documentation Principles

- Documentation should link to files or other documentation appropriately
- Do not use emojis or overly enthusiastic or hype language in documentation
- Do not write specific numbers that will change, like "with over 73.5% coverage"
- Do not write specific call outs of line numbers like, "see fileblah.rs (line 123)", since they will change over time
- When you are done modifying a document, review it for consistency and accuracy

## Markdown Conventions

- Use standard markdown formatting
- Link to related documentation files appropriately
- Use code blocks with language tags for examples
- Keep documentation focused and scannable

## Documentation Structure

For human-readable documentation, see:
- `docs/purpose.md` - Project purpose and goals
- `docs/design.md` - Implementation architecture and design philosophy
- `README.md` - User-facing documentation

## Context Files Documentation

When updating `context/` directory files:
- Update `context/implementation-progress.md` when completing features
- Keep context files focused on implementation details and progress tracking
- Remember that context files are temporary and will be removed once the project reaches maturity
