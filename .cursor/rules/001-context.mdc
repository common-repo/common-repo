# LLM Context Files

The `context/` directory contains detailed implementation plans, progress tracking, and design documents specifically for LLM assistants. These files provide deep context about the project's architecture, implementation status, and future plans.

## Key Context Files

- `context/implementation-progress.md` - Comprehensive tracking of completed features and implementation status
- `context/implementation-plan.md` - Detailed technical implementation plans and architecture decisions
- `context/cli-design.md` - CLI architecture and command structure
- `context/cli-implementation-plan.md` - CLI implementation roadmap
- `context/cli-stub-implementation.md` - CLI stub tracking
- `context/cli-testing-strategy.md` - CLI testing approach and coverage
- `context/merge-operator-testing-guide.md` - Testing guidance for merge operators
- `context/improving-test-coverage-plan.md` - Test coverage analysis and improvement plans

## Important Notes

- These files are temporary and will be removed once the project reaches maturity
- For human-readable documentation, see `docs/purpose.md` and `docs/design.md`
- Update `context/implementation-progress.md` when completing features
- Use these files to understand project architecture, completed work, and future plans
