# Context Files Guidance

The `context/` directory contains task tracking for LLM assistants.

## Active Files

- `context/current-task.json` - Points to active task and its plan file

## Archived Files

Completed plans and status files are stored in `context/completed/`:

- `feature-status.json` - Feature implementation status (all complete)
- `implementation-plan.md` - Technical implementation plans
- `cli-*.md` - CLI design and implementation files
- Various testing guides and plans

## Important Notes

- For human-readable documentation, see `context/purpose.md` and `context/design.md`
- Use archived files to understand project architecture and completed work
