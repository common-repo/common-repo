# Context Files Guidance

The `context/` directory contains detailed implementation plans, progress tracking, and design documents specifically for LLM assistants. These files provide deep context about the project's architecture, implementation status, and future plans.

## Structured Tracking Files

These JSON files track implementation progress and active tasks:

- `context/feature-status.json` - Structured JSON tracking of all feature implementation status
  - **Update this file when completing features**
- `context/current-task.json` - Points to active task and its plan file

## Reference Documentation

These files provide detailed implementation plans and guidance:

- `context/implementation-plan.md` - Detailed technical implementation plans and architecture decisions
- `context/cli-design.md` - CLI architecture and command structure
- `context/cli-implementation-plan.md` - CLI implementation roadmap
- `context/cli-testing-strategy.md` - CLI testing approach and coverage
- `context/merge-operator-testing-guide.md` - Testing guidance for merge operators
- `context/improving-test-coverage-plan.md` - Test coverage analysis and improvement plans

## Temporary Prompt Files

These files are manually invoked prompt files. They are temporary and should not be automatically included:

- `context/prompt.md` - Manually invoked prompt file (temporary, will be removed)
- `context/todo-prompt.md` - Manually invoked prompt file (temporary, will be removed)

**Important**: These `*prompt.md` files are not part of the permanent context and should be manually invoked only when needed.

## Important Notes

- All context files are temporary and will be removed once the project reaches maturity
- For human-readable documentation, see `docs/purpose.md` and `docs/design.md`
- Use these files to understand project architecture, completed work, and future plans
- When completing features, update `context/feature-status.json` with the completion status

## File Organization

The context files are organized by concern:
- **Structured tracking**: `feature-status.json`, `current-task.json`
- **Implementation plans**: `implementation-plan.md`
- **CLI development**: `cli-*.md` files
- **Testing guidance**: `merge-operator-testing-guide.md`, `improving-test-coverage-plan.md`
- **Temporary prompts**: `*prompt.md` files (manually invoked)
