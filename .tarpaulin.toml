# Tarpaulin coverage configuration
#
# This configuration optimizes coverage runs by only instrumenting library tests,
# which reduces coverage time from ~25 minutes to ~2 minutes.

[default]
# Only run library tests (not integration tests, binaries, benchmarks, or examples)
# This dramatically reduces coverage time as there are 27+ test binaries otherwise
run-types = ["Lib"]

# Don't count test function lines themselves in coverage
ignore-tests = true

# Set a reasonable timeout for test execution
timeout = "120s"

# Output formats
out = ["Html", "Stdout"]
